Program Surveys
  During this certificate program, you will be asked to complete a few short surveys. These are part of an important research study to understand how effective the certificate is for participants like you. Make sure to check out below for a rundown of what each survey will cover.

  Heads up: Your survey participation is optional but strongly encouraged. There are no correct answers, and your responses and personal data:

  will not affect your course experience, scores, or ability to receive a certificate or job in any way

  will be kept confidential, with your name separated from your data

  will not be shared outside of our research team except where you give permission to share contact information with hiring partners.

  Thanks for your consideration and time! It is only by hearing from learners like you that our programs can be successful.

Entry survey
  In the following course item, you'll have the opportunity to fill out a brief survey to help us understand why youâ€™ve enrolled in this class. If you do not fill it out, you'll receive an invitation to fill out the survey after completing one lecture or assignment.

  We will ask about your experiences leading up to this course, and what you hope to accomplish. This is critical information for making sure we can meet the needs of learners like you, and can offer this program in the future.

Individual Course Feedback
  When you complete the last graded assignment within an individual course, you may be asked to answer a survey that revisits earlier questions and also asks what you have learned up to that point in the program.

Certificate Completion Survey
  After you complete the last graded assignment in the final course of the certificate, you will be asked to answer a survey that revisits earlier questions.

  It also asks about what you have learned, and if you want to share your contact information with prospective employers.
