1. What’s a computer program?
  * A set of languages available in the computer
  * A process for getting duplicate values removed from a list
  * A list of instructions that the computer has to follow to reach a goal.
  Correcto
  You nailed it! At a basic level, a computer program is a recipe of instructions that tells your computer what to do.
  * A file that gets copied to all machines in the network

2. What’s the syntax of a language?
  * The rules of how to express things in that language.
  Correcto
  Right on! In a human language, syntax is the rules for how a sentence is constructed, and in a programming language, syntax is the rules for how each instruction is written.
  * The subject of a sentence
  * The difference between one language and another
  * The meaning of the words

3. What’s the difference between a program and a script?
  * There’s not much difference, but scripts are usually simpler and shorter.
  Correcto
  You got it! The line between a program and a script is blurry; scripts usually have a shorter development cycle. This means that scripts are shorter, simpler, and can be written very quickly.
  * Scripts are only written in Python.
  * Scripts can only be used for simple tasks.
  * Programs are written by software engineers; scripts are written by system administrators.

4. Which of these scenarios are good candidates for automation? Select all that apply.
  * Generating a sales report, split by region and product type
  Correcto
  Excellent! Creating a report that presents stored data in specific ways is a tedious task that can be easily automated.
  * Creating your own startup company
  * Helping a user who’s having network troubles
  * Copying a file to all computers in a company
  Correcto
  Nice work! A task like copying files to other computers is easily automated, and helps to reduce unnecessary manual work.
  * Interviewing a candidate for a job 
  * Sending personalized emails to subscribers of your website
  Correcto
  Great job! Sending out periodic emails is a time-consuming task that can be easily automated, and you won't have to worry about forgetting to do it on a regular basis.
  * Investigating the root cause of a machine failing to boot

5. What are semantics when applied to programming code and pseudocode?
  * The rules for how a programming instruction is written
  * The difference in number values in one instance of a script compared to another
  * The effect the programming instructions have
  Correcto
  Nice job! Like human language, the intended meaning or effect of words, or in this case instructions, are referred to as semantics.
  * The end result of a programming instruction
