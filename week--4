## What is a string?


Modify the double_word function so that it returns the same word repeated twice, followed by the length of the new doubled word. 
For example, double_word("hello") should return hellohello10.

EXERCISE
def double_word(word):
    return

print(double_word("hello")) # Should return hellohello10
print(double_word("abc"))   # Should return abcabc6
print(double_word(""))      # Should return 0



SOLUTION

def double_word(word):
    word = word *2
    return word + str(len(word))

print(double_word("hello")) # Should return hellohello10
print(double_word("abc"))   # Should return abcabc6
print(double_word(""))      # Should return 0
