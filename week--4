Modify the double_word function so that it returns the same word repeated twice, followed by the length of the new doubled word. 
For example, double_word("hello") should return hellohello10.

{
 "cells": [
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## What is a string?"
   ]
  },
  
def double_word(word):
    return

print(double_word("hello")) # Should return hellohello10
print(double_word("abc"))   # Should return abcabc6
print(double_word(""))      # Should return 0
